bugs:
- items added to the list are duplicated
- items are not untickable
- deleting list items will not actually remove them from the DOM
- input text is not trimmed when adding an item

code smells:
- using 'var' in global script tag (globals in general)
- using 'var' in methods & code blocks
- variables with the same name are declared multiple times in clashing scopes
- styles and scripts should be stored in separate files
- close buttons do not need to be created with code
- code contains easily reusable code that was duplicated
- unhelpful / inconsistent naming across html, javascript and css
- inconsistent usage of single and double quotes in javascript

suggested improvements:
- add column for due date
- add dark theme
