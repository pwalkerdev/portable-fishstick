# Description

This is just a simple Todo list application that gave the old 'yoink & twist' *(I stole it from w3schools and then I changed it slightly)*.  
The intention is to use it as a topic for practical interviews with junior devs.  
Includes some overly critical notes of everything i could be bothered to find which can be used as points for discussion or an exercise.
